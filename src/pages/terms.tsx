                18.8. In the event of a change to a Supported Chain, or other network disruption, resulting in a fork of
                such existing Supported Chain into one (or more) additional blockchains, Interface and/or Protocol may
                not support activity related to any new digital assets created as a result of the fork. In addition, in
                the event of a fork, transactions on such Supported Chain may be disrupted, including transactions
                involving Interface and/or Protocol and such Supported Chain.

                fee may fluctuate over time depending on a variety of factors, and you are solely responsible for paying
                transaction fees associated with transactions you engage in on such Supported Chain using Interface
                and/or Protocol and are also solely responsible for any other third-party fees that may be incurred in
                connection with your access and/or use of Interface and/or Protocol.
